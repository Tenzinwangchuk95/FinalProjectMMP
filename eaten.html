      What were you even thinking. You have never fought anything in your life before and now you think you stand a chance against something that is 4 times your size. This was the biggest mistake you could have made and now you are doomed. The plant quickly takes a lunge at you with it's mouth and has you in its clutches. You are chewed and swallowed with no effort at all. There was never any hope in fighting. What a fool you are.......
