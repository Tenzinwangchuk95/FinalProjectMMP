      You now know that you are lost for sure. You lose hope and its become to dark to see anything past the trees. You are tired, hungry, and lost. A combination most deadly and time has run out. You embrace death and think apon the choices you've made and think maybe some better decisions could have been chosen. YOU ARE DEAD.....
