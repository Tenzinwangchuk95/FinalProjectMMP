      You enter the thick forest and there dosnt seem to be an end to it. You walk for what seems to be hours and with no end in sight you begin to wonder if you've been walking in circles. You eventually come across an injured person. You arent sure how long they've been there but you know you can either help or keep going on your own. You do need to look out for yourself and at this point another person to look after might just drag you down. Will you help the person or leave him to die???
