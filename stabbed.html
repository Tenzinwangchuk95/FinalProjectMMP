      You help the person and soon realize that this person that seemed ordinary at a glance isn't so ordinary. They quickly pull out the hidden dagger and take 3 quick stabs at your chest. As you lay there in shock the person rummages through your belongings and take everything you have. They dont even look back as they move into the distance. You think back on the choices you've made. You made the right ones. Why have they lead you here. Why are is there no good ending. What was the point of all this. Maybe some storys have no happy ending.
